I hold a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh advised by G. Bard Ermentrout, and now hold a postdoctoral position at the University of Manitoba advised by St\'{e}phanie Portet (funded by a \textbf{PIMS Postdoctoral Fellowship}). %My research includes the analysis and modeling of biological systems using \textit{deterministic and stochastic differential equations}, \textit{Markov processes}, \textit{hybrid systems}, and \textit{bifurcation theory}. Biological domains include neuroscience, cell physiology, and gene expression.
