I will enhance the department's reputation through grant funding and my \textbf{interdisciplinary research program}. I use a variety of methods from \textbf{stochastic and deterministic dynamical systems} to solve problems of oscillator synchrony, molecular motor transport in cells, and network function in biological systems.

%My research includes the analysis and modeling of biological systems using \textit{deterministic and stochastic differential equations}, \textit{Markov processes}, \textit{hybrid systems}, and \textit{bifurcation theory}. Biological domains include neuroscience, cell physiology, and gene expression.
