I am committed to exceptional education with a teaching portfolio boasting eight years of teaching the calculus sequence, differential equations, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics.  My students do not learn in a vacuum, but instead learn concepts alongside the human triumph and defeat behind many concepts we take for granted today, such as matrix notation and complex numbers. My approach has led to consistently strong student evaluations and a shortlist for the \textbf{Elizabeth Baranger teaching award}, the most prestigious teaching award at the University of Pittsburgh.



  %I have also served as a guest lecturer for underprivileged Bangladeshi children at the Free Library of Philadelphia, and gave neuroscience lectures at Waltham High School in Boston.
