I will augment their work through collaborations and further enhance the department's reputation through grant funding and my \textbf{interdisciplinary research program}. I use a variety of methods from \textbf{stochastic and deterministic dynamical systems} to solve problems of oscillator synchrony, molecular motor transport in neurons, and network function in biological systems.
