I am also committed to providing high-quality and equal education for all my students, as evidenced by my teaching evaluations. My teaching portfolio boasts eight years of teaching at different capacities (lectures, recitations, grading), at different levels (calculus sequence, differential equations, linear algebra, and discrete math), and at different institutions (Oberlin College, Case Western Reserve University, University of Pittsburgh, and Brandeis University). As a doctoral student, my students shortlisted me for the \textbf{Elizabeth Baranger teaching award}, the most prestigious teaching award at the University of Pittsburgh. I have also served as a guest lecturer for underprivileged Bangladeshi children at the Free Library of Philadelphia.

I strongly believe in the principle that learning is best accomplished with context and practice. My students do not learn in a vacuum, but instead learn concepts alongside the human triumph and defeat behind many concepts we take for granted today, such as matrix notation and Euclid's fifth postulate. Students at \School~will greatly benefit from this approach, and in turn, will drive me towards excellent instruction.
