I hold a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh advised by G. Bard Ermentrout, and now hold a postdoctoral position at Brandeis University advised by Thomas G. Fai. I specialize in \textbf{deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems}, \textbf{bifurcation theory}, \textbf{perturbation methods}, and \textbf{non-local integro-differential equations}, with applications to neuroscience and cell physiology.  I also excel in analyzing \textbf{large data sets} using state-of-the-art \textbf{subspace identification methods} and \textbf{machine learning methods} including \textbf{stochastic gradient descent} and \textbf{hierarchical clustering}.
