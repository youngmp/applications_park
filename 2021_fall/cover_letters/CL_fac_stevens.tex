\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am applying for the assistant professor tenure-track position at \School~Department of Mathematical Sciences. \input{intro0_dyn}

\input{research}

\School~features top researchers in applied mathematics (including \textbf{Darinka Dentcheva}), but representation in mathematical neuroscience is less salient. I will enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program: I use dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to solve problems of oscillator synchrony, molecular transport in neurons, and network function in biological systems (through subspace identification and machine learning).

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, and research statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
