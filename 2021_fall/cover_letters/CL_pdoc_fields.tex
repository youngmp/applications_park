\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am applying for the Simons Postdoctoral Fellowship at the \School. \input{intro0}

\input{research}

The \School~would afford an opportunity to work with Sue Ann Campbell, a top researcher in mathematical neuroscience. My skill set will bolster her existing work through collaborations, and complement their work through independent research. I offer a decade's worth of experience in solving problems of oscillator entrainment and synchrony, and firmly believe that my presence will bolster University of Waterloo and the \School's  reputation in applied mathematics.

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae and research statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
