\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,}

I am applying for the position of Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Mathematics at \School. \input{intro0_dyn}

\input{research}

\School~features strong researchers in mathematical and computational biology (with faculty such as \textbf{Steven Zhengfu Xu}), but representation in mathematical neuroscience is less salient. I will enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program in neuroscience. I use dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to solve problems of phase-locking in neural oscillators, molecular transport in cell physiology, and dysfunctional biological networks (through subspace identification and machine learning).

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
