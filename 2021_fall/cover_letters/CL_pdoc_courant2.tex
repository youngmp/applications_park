\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,}

I am applying for the position of Courant Instructor (RTG-CI) at \School. \input{intro0}

\input{research}

\School~features strong researchers in mathematical and computational biology including \textbf{Charles Peskin} and \textbf{John Rinzel}. My research experience will augment their work through collaborations, and I will enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program. I use dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to solve problems of oscillator synchrony in chemical and biologcal networks, molecular transport in neurons, and network function in biological systems (through subspace identification and machine learning).

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
