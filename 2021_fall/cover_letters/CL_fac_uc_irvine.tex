\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,}

I am applying for the position of Assistant Professor in Math Biology at the \School~Department of Mathematics. \input{intro0_dyn}

\input{research}

\School~features strong researchers in mathematical biology including \textbf{Jun Allard} and \textbf{Natalia Komarova}. However, representation in mathematical neuroscience is less salient. My research experience in dynamical systems and molecular motors will augment their work through collaborations, and I will enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program. I use dynamical systems, in particular bifurcation theory, subspace identification, and machine learning, to solve problems of network function in the mammalian cortex.

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
