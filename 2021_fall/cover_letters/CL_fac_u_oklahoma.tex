\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,}

I am applying for the position of tenure-track assistant professor at the \School~Department of Mathematics. \input{intro0_dyn}

\input{research}

\School~features strong researchers whose work includes the natural sciences including, \textbf{Ying Wang}, but representation in mathematical neuroscience is less salient. I will augment their work through collaborations, and I will enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program. I use dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to solve problems of neural phase-locking, molecular transport in neurons, and cortical network function (through subspace identification and machine learning).

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
