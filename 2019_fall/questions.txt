questions for dan

my goal is to become an assistant professor in a math department.

-would working in an engineering department hurt my chances if i want to work in an applied math or math  department?
-what are the standard duties of a postdoc in your lab?
-what funding opportunities are available?
-would an NSF postdoc make sense to apply to?
-what oportunities for teaching will i have?
-would it be possible to set up an  adjunct appointment in the math department so i can teach math classes and/or mentor math students?


-wil you be continue working with isostables/phase reduction?
the iPRC is phase sensitivity. is there a way to think of isostables in terms of oscillator timing?

-youve extended the theory of isostables to nonsmooth systems with discontinuous solutions. have you started to think about non-transverse limit cycles? peter thomas has started doing this with yang yang for the adjoint/iPRC.
