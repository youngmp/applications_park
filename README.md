All postdoc and faculty applications in applied math, Fall 2017-- Spring 2022

I have not checked that everything will compile and I will not provide missing files. Some PDFs have corresponding tex files, some do not. However, most files are human-readable plain text, or PDFs, so take what you need. The organization differs significantly from year-to-year.

The vast majority of applications were submitted through mathjobs.org.

Timeline:
* Fall 2017: Postdoc offers from University of Houston, University of Pennsylvania, and Brandeis. (These applications have not been included)
* Fall 2018--Spring 2019: Postdoc offers from Brandeis and University of Tennessee Knoxville
* Fall 2019--Spring 2020: Did not apply
* Fall 2020--Spring 2021: Postdoc offer from University of Manitoba
* Fall 2021--Spring 2022: One tenure-track job offer.
