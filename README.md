# applications_park
All postdoc and faculty applications in mathematical biology (applied dynamical systems and modeling), Fall 2017-- Spring 2022

Everything here is as-is, and not all TeX files have been verified to compile. Some PDFs have corresponding tex files, some do not. However, all files are human-readable plain text or PDFs, so take what you need. The organization differs significantly from year-to-year.

The vast majority of applications were submitted through mathjobs.org.

Timeline:
* Fall 2017--Spring 2018: Postdoc only
* Fall 2018--Spring 2019: Postdoc, teaching, and TT jobs ([detailed spreadsheet postdocs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBtQXkd6NE0SXssUmOFg7uNBW9h4e13z52SG2MlQlPU/edit?usp=sharing) [detailed spreadsheet TT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sZDx5RBKGz5OCMih_9A0wyGd_F32A5ila2AXQ96gMcU/edit?usp=sharing))
