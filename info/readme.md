# Preamble

* This document will be updated occasionally and will be under construction for a long time. Please see the history and diffs to check for updates.

* **If nothing else, read the presentation by Chris Kapulkin (at Western University) [here](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/academic-jobs-Western-September-2018.pdf).** It is well worth your time.

* This document is meant to give you one more data point to help inform your decisions. Nothing here is sacred or absolutely true. Always consult second opinions.

* There is a hamburger menu at the top right of this text area. Click it to view the table of contents.

## Abbreviations
* TT: Tenure-Track
* R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity
* R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity
* LAC: Liberal arts college

## Assumptions
* You are in a PhD program or have a PhD in mathematics or applied mathematics.
* You eventually want an academic faculty position in a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) department at a doctoral university, as opposed to an industry or national lab position.

## Biases
* I am not a pure mathematician, I am a (very) applied mathematician in math bio.
* My advice is primarily tailored for R1 positions, but much applies to R2s and LACs. There are also plenty of applications for R2s, and LACs in this repository.

# Ideal conditions before applying

Note that these are only **ideal** conditions. They are neither necessary nor sufficient to obtain a postdoc or faculty position due to significant stochasticity in the hiring process. If you are less strong in one or more of these categories, do your best to improve them as you can, but do not despair if you cannot.

## Networking
Networking $\equiv$ making friends. Chat with people in your department, outside your department. Show interest in them and what they do. Ask about what they are working on. Ask about their hobbies. You don't have to be close friends, but at the very least be cordial and genuine.
* Conferences are a natural place to network. Make new friends, reach out to professors in your field, reach out to old colleagues/friends, and show genuine interest. Talk to junior and senior grad students. Introduce yourself to various people at every level. Yes it is difficult and exhausting, but it is important.
* If you have trouble talking to people, find ways to learn how. Learning how to socialize is a tractable problem no matter how severe your social anxiety. I'm not saying it is easy, but it is possible.
* If you feel discouraged by a series of negative interactions, just remember that this is all a game of chance and negative outcomes can last longer than expected. Take a break if needed, but don't stop trying in the long term.
* * Also make sure to assess your actions honestly. It can be easy to come across negatively without meaning to, but this can be fixed with time.

## Publishing
Do your best to publish as much as is appropriate for your field in reputable journals.
* Impact factor: In my field, impact factor is less important. Reputable journals (e.g., Chaos, SIAM DS, SIAM Applied Math, Journal of Computational Neuroscience, Journal of Mathematical Biology, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology) tend to have impact factors around 1, which is quite low in other scientific fields. So be sure to ask questions to get a sense of what "reputable" means in your field.
* Number of publications: At least 1 is a good start if you are close to finishing your PhD, then 1 per postdoc. In more computational fields, this number might be much higher, and in more theory-heavy fields, this number might be much lower, so again consult with others in your field to get a good sense of what is appropriate.

## Teaching
Develop significant teaching experience leading recitaitons or lectures.
* Save evaluations from each course (evaluations should be administered by the university and **not** by a third party, e.g., RateMyProfessors). "Plenty" is also field-dependent, so ask around.
* For some frame of reference, I taught the equivalent of 3 recitations per semester (where 2 recitations were viewed as equal to 1 lecture) and one lecture every Summer.
* I happened to teach less as a postdoc, on the order of at most 1 lecture per semester, and was told by a pure mathematician that this is generally not enough teaching if I am competing for TT positions in math departments. So I sought more teaching assignments (note that I have seen evidence of actively seeking out additional teaching as viewed positively in TT hiring committees).
* Presenting: You should have experience presenting posters or talks at conferences. As a graduate student I gave oral or poster presentations once every one or two years. As a postdoc, I traveled to multiple conferences a year (averaged maybe 2 a year, but I traveled more some years than others). My impression is that these numbers are a decent baseline for applied math.

# Application process

Applied and pure co-exist on a fine gradient, but I will artificially separate them for the sake of organization. If you are more from the pure end, it may still help to skim the applied math resources below.

## Pure math

* Read the presentation by Chris Kapulkin (at Western University) [here](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/academic-jobs-Western-September-2018.pdf). It is well worth your time to read.
* Look for jobs on mathjobs.org. Every reputable math department posts job openings there.
* More to come...

## Applied math

All of the above applies, but applied mathematicians can also apply to individuals with grant funding (this is slowly becoming more true of pure mathematicians too). Much of the advice will be spoken in terms of someone in math bio, but the concepts should hold in other fields.

### Finding job openings

Outside of mathjobs.org, there are a few options:
* Look up people that you are interested in working with. People often post job openings on their websites.
* Subscribe to listservs because they often post job openings from PhD through faculty positions.
  * Computational neuroscience listserv: https://lists.cnsorg.org/postorius/lists/comp-neuro.lists.cnsorg.org
  * SIAM Life Sciences activity group mailing list https://lists.siam.org/mailman/listinfo/siam-ls (Google for other SIAM activity groups)
  * SIAM Dynamical Systems activity group mailing list https://lists.siam.org/mailman/listinfo/siam-dy

Last resort methods:
* Search other job outlets, e.g., https://www.higheredjobs.com/
* Email professors directly, whether you know them or not. Include a brief explanation of who you are, why you are contacting them, and include a CV. Be specific by mentioning exactly how you could contribute to their research. Otherwise, it's very easy to ignore the email.
* Search the job pages at universities, colleges, community colleges

# Information for Interviews

* [The Professor is In](https://theprofessorisin.com) is a great blog that helped prepare me for my final application cycle

# Career Changes
This section has some information about transitioning form pure math to applied math, or from math/applied math to science. These are only guidelines and observations from the perspective of one person, so be sure to seek second opinions.

## Pure to Applied Math

* **Learn how to program**.
  * Project Euler is a great way to learn how to program with interesting problems (you can connect with me [here](https://projecteuler.net/progress=yxp30)).
* The programming language you choose to learn should suit what you want to do.
* Roughly speaking:
  * Statistics: R, Python, MATLAB
  * Machine learning/AI/data science: Python, MATLAB
  * Biostatistics/genetics: Perl
  * Game development/graphics: C++, Lua

## Math/Applied Math to Science, Engineering, or Medicine
Repeat after me: **LEARN TO WRITE, LEARN TO WRITE, LEARN TO WRITE, LEARN TO WRITE, ...** Someone with mathematical training tends to be poorly trained in writing, even if they've published a large number of papers.

* The sciences, engineering, and medicine generally require far more grants, and obtaining at least one big grant is usually an expectation for tenure  (e.g., NIH R01 grants, which average 600,000 USD and commonly number in millions of dollars).
  * Undergrads, and especially graduate students, postdocs, and faculty live and die by grants.
  * Positions in scientific disciplines are largely funded by grants (in contrast to math, which traditionally funds PhD, postdoc, and faculty positions through teaching and college or department funds).
  * You will need to significantly improve your writing, with a special focus on grantsmanship in particular. Attend workshops and seek feedback as much as is reasonable and possible.
* PIs in non-math fields typically have larger groups than in math, which is possible because of grants.
* Ask people in the field you want to work in what their day-to-day life is like. Doing this is important to help manage expectations.
  * I know of cases where even those who *wanted* to switch fields from math to science and *fully understood what to expect* took 5+ years to reach a point where they felt comfortable.
* More to come...

# FAQ

> How come you applied to so many places for postdocs? It is my understanding even top universities have trouble hiring postdocs. And you seem to have a great track record with lots of low-author-count papers and even an award during your PhD. Couldn't your advisors help you find something? Or were you looking for something else?
In short, traditional math postdocs in the US are very difficult to get and I would say are often as competitive as faculty positions. Math postdocs are hired by math departments (as opposed to individuals with funding), so the postdoc must be extremely good at what they do and also show strong potential to co-author with many others in the department. They must also be reasonably good teachers and be able to carry a high teaching load (anywhere from 1-1 to 4-4, but 2-2 is common), because their primary source of funding is through teaching. These conditions alone seriously restrict potential hires, even though one department advertising one position will receive 200 applicants (give or take 100).

So I've been shortlisted once or twice, but never really got a proper department postdoc. The few times I was shortlisted was because the department happened to have a distinct group in applied math that had much more control over postdoc hiring decisions. Lots of this is can be independent of who your advisor knows, since math postdocs have to appeal to everyone in the department and not just one person. If your advisor is in pure math, they can certainly have more sway than mine, who is squarely in applied math.

The only postdocs I've gotten were funded by grants, and this was only possible because I'm in applied math, which sits in an awkward (but good) position between pure math and the sciences. On the one hand, applied math people don't get as much funding as scientists with labs, but on the other hand, we tend to get more funding than pure math people and thus tend to have more postdocs.

FYI, from conversations with pure math people, 50/year is a minimum number for postdoc applications and applying to 100-200/year is normal. The highest I heard is 400 in one year.

> When do they ever find time to work if they're sending >1 applications / day??

Yes, it's about as crazy as you think. On the one hand, applications are done through mathjobs, so all the application materials (including letters) are on one site and it's a little easier to shotgun applications. On the other hand, the interface isn't great and all application materials need to be adjusted often for each institution (especially the EDI and cover letter). So people end up taking weeks to months off to apply.

# Appendix

## Postdoc Statistics
* We recieved 357 applications two postdoc positions in Fall 2025. This should give you an idea of just how competitive math postdocs are.

## Key differences between math and non-math fields that are never discussed
* Always be aware of words that seem unambiguous to you, but are viewed very differently by different fields.
  * **Co-author** vs **Collaborator**: In the sciences, "collaborator" is someone who has a grant with you. This term is distinct from "co-author", who is simply someone who has appeared on a paper with you. In math, co-author and collaborator are equivalent.
* **Frequency of grant-writing**: Science PIs write dozens of R01 grants (on the order of millions give or take half a million) to fund grad students, buy equipment, and pay publishing fees. It is common in the sciences to write a grant once an idea exists. In contrast, mathematicians write grants with relatively more complete ideas at a lower frequency.
* **Building Collaborations**: Collaborations take a long time to build in the sciences. They require months of correspondences to feel out potential contributions from each person and to see if the lab/equipment/personnel would be a right fit for the project for all parties. In contrast, collaborations can often be instantaneous in math because people tend to have a clearer picture of each others' potential contributions. This difference arises simply because there are many, many more moving parts involved in a scientific collaboration.
