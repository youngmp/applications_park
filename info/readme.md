# General Information

Applied and pure exist on a gradient, but I will artificially separate them for the sake of organization.

## Application process for pure math

Please see the presentation written by Chris Kapulkin (at Wester University) [here](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/academic-jobs-Western-September-2018.pdf). It is well worth your time to read.

## Application process for applied math

All of the above applies, but applied mathematicians can also apply to individuals with grant funding.

# FAQ

More information will be added as people ask questions.

> How come you applied to so many places for postdocs? It is my understanding even top universities have trouble hiring postdocs. And you seem to have a great track record with lots of low-author-count papers and even an award during your PhD. Couldn't your advisors help you find something? Or were you looking for something else?
In short, traditional math postdocs in the US are very difficult to get and in some cases might be almost as competitive as faculty positions. Math postdocs are hired by math departments (as opposed to individuals with funding), so the postdoc must be extremely good at what they do and also show strong potential to co-author with many others in the department. They must also be reasonably good teachers and be able to carry a high teaching load (anywhere from 1-1 to 4-4, but 2-2 is common), because their primary source of funding is through teaching. These conditions alone seriously restrict potential hires, even though one department advertising one position will receive 200 applicants (give or take 100).

So I've been shortlisted once or twice, but never really got a proper department postdoc. The few times I was shortlisted was because the department happened to have a distinct group in applied math that had much more control over postdoc hiring decisions. Lots of this is can be independent of who your advisor knows, since math postdocs have to appeal to everyone in the department and not just one person. EDIT 2: If your advisor is in pure math, they can certainly have more sway than mine, who is/was squarely in applied math.

The only postdocs I've gotten were funded by grants, and this was only possible because I'm in applied math, which sits in an awkward (but good) position between pure math and the sciences. On the one hand, applied math people don't get as much funding as scientists with labs, but on the other hand, we tend to get more funding than pure math people and thus tend to have more postdocs.

FYI, from conversations with pure math people, 50/year is a minimum number for postdoc applications and applying to 100-200/year is normal. The highest I heard is 400 in one year.

> When do they ever find time to work if they're sending >1 applications / day??
Yes, it's about as crazy as you think. On the one hand, applications are done through mathjobs, so all the application materials (including letters) are on one site and it's a little easier to shotgun applications. On the other hand, the interface isn't great and all application materials need to be adjusted often for each institution (especially the EDI and cover letter). So people end up taking weeks to months off to apply.
