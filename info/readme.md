This document will be updated occasionally and will be under construction for a long time. Please see the diffs to check for updates.

If nothing else, read the presentation by Chris Kapulkin (at Western University) [here](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/academic-jobs-Western-September-2018.pdf). **It is well worth your time to read**.

This document is meant to give you one more data point to help inform your decisions. Nothing here is sacred or absolutely true.

Assumptions:
* You have a PhD in mathematics or applied mathematics, or close to graduating and starting to think about postdocs.
* You eventually want an academic faculty position in a math or applied math department (as opposed to industry or national lab positions).
* You have a background in pure math and want a postdoc/faculty position in applied math or science (i.e., want to change careers).

Biases:
* I am not a pure mathematician, I am a (very) applied mathematician in math bio.
* My applications and CV are primarily tailored for R1 (Doctoral Universities â€“ Very high research activity) positions.

# Ideal conditions before applying

Note that these are only **ideal** conditions. They are neither necessary nor sufficient to obtain a postdoc or faculty position due to significant stochasticity in the hiring process. If you are less strong in one of these categories, do your best to improve it if you have time, but do not despair otherwise.
* **Networking**: If you go to conferences and speak to many people, then great! If you are like me and are very shy and didn't really network very well throughout your PhD, then now is a good a time as any. In the next conference, make new friends (network), reach out to professors in your field, reach out to old colleagues/friends, and show interest in them and their work. It also doesn't hurt to introduce yourself to various people at every level. Yes it is difficult and exhausting, but it is important.
* Publishing: It goes without saying that published papers should be in reputable journals. In my field, impact factor is less important and reputable journals (Chaos, SIAM DS, SIAM Applied Math, Journal of Computational Neuroscience, Journal of Mathematical Biology) tend to have impact factors around 1, which is quite low in other scientific fields. So be sure to ask questions to get a sense of what "reputable" means in your field. As far as number of publications, at least 1 is a good start if you are close to finishing your PhD, then 1 per postdoc. In more computational fields, this number might be much higher, and in more theory-heavy fields, this number might be much lower, so again consult with others in your field to get a good sense of what is appropriate.
* Teaching: You should have plenty of teaching experience leading recitaitons or lectures for undergraduate classes. Save evaluations from each course (evaluations should be administered by the university and not from, e.g., RateMyProfessors). "Plenty" is also field-dependent, so ask around. In my case, I taught the equivalent of 3 recitations per semester and one lecture every Summer. I taught less as a postdoc, on the order of at most 1 lecture per semester, and was told by a pure mathematician that this is generally not enough if I am competing for TT positions in math departments.
* Presenting: You should have experience presenting posters or talks at conferences. As a graduate student I gave oral or poster presentations once every one or two years. As a postdoc, I traveled to multiple conferences a year (averaged maybe 2 a year, but I traveled more some years than others). My impression is that these numbers are a decent baseline for applied math.

# Application process

Applied and pure co-exist on a fine gradient, but I will artificially separate them for the sake of organization. I've tried to make this document skimmable, so if you are more from the pure end, it may still help to skim the applied math resources below.

## Pure math

Read the presentation by Chris Kapulkin (at Western University) [here](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/academic-jobs-Western-September-2018.pdf). It is well worth your time to read.

## Applied math

All of the above applies, but applied mathematicians can also apply to individuals with grant funding. This is slowly becoming more true of pure mathematicians too, but for now I will restrict my focus to the very applied end of the spectrum. Much of the advice will be spoken in terms of someone in math bio, but the concepts should hold in other fields.

### Finding job openings

Outside of mathjobs.org, there are a few options:
* Look up people that you are interested in working with. People often post their "wanted" ads on their websites.
* Subscribe to listservs because they often post job openings from PhD through faculty positions.
  * Computational neuroscience listserv: https://lists.cnsorg.org/postorius/lists/comp-neuro.lists.cnsorg.org
  * SIAM Life Sciences activity group mailing list https://lists.siam.org/mailman/listinfo/siam-ls (Google for other SIAM activity groups)
  * SIAM Dynamical Systems activity group mailing list https://lists.siam.org/mailman/listinfo/siam-dy

Last resort methods:
* Search other job outlets, e.g., https://www.higheredjobs.com/
* Email professors directly, whether you know them or not. Include a brief explanation of who you are, why you are contacting them, and include a CV. Be specific, or else it's epecially easy to ignore the email
* Search the job pages at universities, colleges, community colleges

# Information for interviews

* The Professor is In is a great blog that helped prepare me for my final application cycle theprofessorisin.com

# Career changes
As mentioned above, this section has some information about transitioning form pure math to applied, or from applied math to science. Please remember that these are only guidelines from the perspective of one person.

## Pure math to applied

* TBD...

## Applied math to science

* **Math and science are very different in practice**
  * The sciences generally require far more grants (undergrads, graduate students, postdocs, faculty all live and die by grants).
  * Math tends to require more teaching (anywhere from 1-1 to 5-5).
* Ask people in the field you want to work in what their day-to-day life is like.
* More to come...

# FAQ

> How come you applied to so many places for postdocs? It is my understanding even top universities have trouble hiring postdocs. And you seem to have a great track record with lots of low-author-count papers and even an award during your PhD. Couldn't your advisors help you find something? Or were you looking for something else?
In short, traditional math postdocs in the US are very difficult to get and in some cases might be almost as competitive as faculty positions. Math postdocs are hired by math departments (as opposed to individuals with funding), so the postdoc must be extremely good at what they do and also show strong potential to co-author with many others in the department. They must also be reasonably good teachers and be able to carry a high teaching load (anywhere from 1-1 to 4-4, but 2-2 is common), because their primary source of funding is through teaching. These conditions alone seriously restrict potential hires, even though one department advertising one position will receive 200 applicants (give or take 100).

So I've been shortlisted once or twice, but never really got a proper department postdoc. The few times I was shortlisted was because the department happened to have a distinct group in applied math that had much more control over postdoc hiring decisions. Lots of this is can be independent of who your advisor knows, since math postdocs have to appeal to everyone in the department and not just one person. If your advisor is in pure math, they can certainly have more sway than mine, who is squarely in applied math.

The only postdocs I've gotten were funded by grants, and this was only possible because I'm in applied math, which sits in an awkward (but good) position between pure math and the sciences. On the one hand, applied math people don't get as much funding as scientists with labs, but on the other hand, we tend to get more funding than pure math people and thus tend to have more postdocs.

FYI, from conversations with pure math people, 50/year is a minimum number for postdoc applications and applying to 100-200/year is normal. The highest I heard is 400 in one year.

> When do they ever find time to work if they're sending >1 applications / day??
Yes, it's about as crazy as you think. On the one hand, applications are done through mathjobs, so all the application materials (including letters) are on one site and it's a little easier to shotgun applications. On the other hand, the interface isn't great and all application materials need to be adjusted often for each institution (especially the EDI and cover letter). So people end up taking weeks to months off to apply.
