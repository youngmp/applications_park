\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,}

I am applying for the position of tenure-track assistant professor in Computational Neuroscience at the \School Center for Neuroscience. \input{intro0_dyn}

\input{research}

The Center for Neuroscience features strong researchers in computational neuroscience including \textbf{Mark Goldman}, \textbf{Jochen Ditterich}, and \textbf{Tim Hanks}. I will augment their work through collaborations, and I will enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program. I use dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to solve problems of neural phase-locking, molecular transport in neurons, and cortical network function (through subspace identification and machine learning).

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
