DAVID MCLAUGHLIN (theoretical visual neuroscience):

DANIEL TReNCHINA (stochastic processes)

questions:
-what are the class sizes
-what classes will i teach
-roughyl speaking, what is your individual training plan for your trainees, and does your philosophy differ greatly between the professors?
-does the lab/institution have funding for conferences or annual meetings?
-how often does your lab publish?
-what have postdocs done after leaving the lab?
-do you encourage postdocs to apply for fellowships?
-do you have a specific project from your ongoing work or should i design my own?
