We’re delighted to announce the formation of the University of Washington Computational Neuroscience Center (compneuro.washington.edu).  The Center brings together research across the full spectrum of mechanisms and functions of the brain, developing new theoretical, computational and statistical tools to unify and interpret the extraordinary data on neural systems being gathered by our partners in Seattle and around the world.

Come join us!

Faculty positions: We’re hiring an assistant professor to join the UW-CNC in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. Application review is still open!  http://depts.washington.edu/pbiopage/2017-compneuro-faculty-search/

Center administrator: We have an opening for someone passionate about facilitating and building the interdisciplinary scientific community of the UW-CNC.  Role includes administering training programs and outreach, grantwriting support for center grants, organizing conferences and meetings, and recruiting for the center, with opportunities for writing about the center and its science and more.  Please send a cv/resume and statement of interest to cncadmin@uw.edu.

Postdoctoral positions: We are hiring a postdoctoral fellow to join our Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, position available immediately.  To apply send a research statement, cv and the contact information for at least two referees to cncadmin@uw.edu

Graduate students: UW has numerous graduate programs suitable for students interested in neural computation. Funding and training opportunities are many, including NIH Training Program in Neural Computation and Engineering at UW, the Big Data in Genomics and Neuroscience Training Grant, the University of Washington Institute for Neuroengineering, and the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering.
