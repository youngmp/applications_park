\opening{Dear Dr. Robert GÃ¼tig:}

 My name is Youngmin Park. I am a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh department of mathematics, working in the areas of weakly coupled oscillators and neural field models. I expect to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in May of 2018 under the direction of my advsior Bard Ermentrout. I would like to apply for a postdoctoral position in your group.
 
 With my application, I include the standard AMS cover letter, a curriculum vitae, a research statement, and a list of references.
 
 Some highlights of my file are:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Andrew Mellon Predoctoral Research Fellowship award recipient
  \item Journal publications in SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems and Springer Journal of Computational Neuroscience.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 I understand that my work is largely applied math, but I am more than willing to transition to theoretical neuroscience.
 
 Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

 \closing{Sincerely,}
 
 
 
\end{letter}
