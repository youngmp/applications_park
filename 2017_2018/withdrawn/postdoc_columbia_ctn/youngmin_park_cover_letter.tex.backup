\opening{Dear Dr. Maria Geffen:}

My name is Youngmin Park. I am a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh department of mathematics, working in the areas of weakly coupled oscillators and neural field models. I expect to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in May of 2018 under the direction of my advsior Bard Ermentrout. I would like to apply for a postdoctoral position in your group.
 
My work is largely in the realm of applied mathematics. My masters thesis is on the phase response curve of piecewise smooth oscillators, a topic which I continue to pursue today. In addition, more recent work involves the reduction of high dimensional conductance-based or mean-field models to low dimensional scalar models. I understand these techniques are not well-suited for 

With my application, I include a curriculum vitae and a list of publications.
 
Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Youngmin Park
