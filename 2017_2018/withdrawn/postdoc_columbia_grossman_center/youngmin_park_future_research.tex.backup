In the immediate future, I plan to finish my current work. My doctoral work continues in the form of collaborations, and will conclude on a third paper, and my masters work continues in the form of an $n$-dimensional generalization of the planar result of my masters thesis. 
In the long term, I am interested in learning the skills and mathematics necessary to address general problems that arise in neuroscience.

To conclude my Doctorate work, we are seeking to rigorously derive the connection between mean field neural networks and neural activity at the spiking level. In particular, we consider a system of synaptically coupled oscillators that generate a limit cycle oscillation at the mean field level in the synaptic variables. The synchronization properties at the spiking level are not well understood.

Our strong assumption is that the synapses of the network must be sufficiently slow. In this case, we can rephrase the problem as a weak coupling problem \cite{rubinrubin}. Although great strides are made in \cite{rubinrubin} and \cite{park2016weakly} to help connect the spiking description to the mean field description, the story is still incomplete. In \cite{rubinrubin}, the underlying slowly varying activity was kept constant to allow for a standard phase reduction. The results in \cite{park2016weakly} partially address this issue by deriving a phase reduction technique when there is an exogenous slowly varying parameter that is independent of the fast timescale activity. However, the slow dynamics of this third project are generated as part of the dynamical system, and we have yet to derive a proper phase reduction in this case.

\subsection{General Weakly Coupled Piecewise Smooth Oscillators}
In addition to these primary studies, I have other collaborations. For instance, I have continued to build on my masters work in continued collaborations with my masters thesis advisor Peter J. Thomas (with colleagues Hillel J. Chiel and Kendrick M. Shaw). We have written a manuscript for an $n$-dimensional generalization of this result and have started to apply the result to a weakly coupled piecewise smooth systems \cite{park2016infinitesimal}. Most existing literature on coupling of piecewise smooth systems are often restricted to one or a combination of linear coupling, planar systems, and piecewise linear vector fields \cite{coombes2016synchrony,izhikevich2000phase,coombes2012nonsmooth}. Although we do require solutions to be continuous, our weak coupling analysis applies to piecewise smooth systems of arbitrary dimension with nonlinear, heterogeneous coupling. This work has been submitted.

\subsection{A New Way to Compute Isochrons}
In another collaboration, I am working with another graduate student named Benjamin G. Letson to construct a numerical scheme for the computation of isochrons of limit cycles without using \texttt{AUTO}. The underlying analysis involves a change of coordinates to a moving frame with axes that are perpendicular and parallel to the underlying limit cycle solution. In this new frame, isochrons are relatively easy to visualize in principle. There are many numerical details yet to be ironed out.
