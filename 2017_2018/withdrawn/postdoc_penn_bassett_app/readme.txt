We welcome applications from talented undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars. We seek individuals from varied backgrounds, with interests in theoretical and/or biological physics, applied mathematics, engineering, network science, complex systems, systems neuroscience, cognitive and clinical neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology, computational biology, computer science, or social networks. Inquiries should include a cover letter and current CV. 

Dr. Bassett is a faculty member of the Bioengineering Graduate Group, the Electrical and Systems Engineering Graduate Group, Physics Graduate Group, the Applied Math and Computational Science Graduate Group, the Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Group, and the Neuroscience Graduate Group, and therefore can supervise PhD students wishing to pursue degrees in bioengineering, electrical and systems engineering, physics, applied mathematics, genomics & computational biology, neuroscience, and psychology.
