Mathematical Neuroscience Research Fellow (full time 3 year appointment)
- Innovative biomedical modelling
- Attractive salary packaging & superannuation options

This research fellow will pursue large-scale computational modelling and
simulation of brain activity, and innovative analyses of time series and
neuroimaging data, with particular focus on epilepsy.

*Responsibilities*

- You will contribute to developing and analysing new mathematical models of
  large-scale brain activity, including both biophysical neural mass models and
  networks of non-linear oscillators.

- Simulate computational models on GPUs or high performance computing clusters,
  and collaborate in applying these to clinical and neuroscience research.

- Perform innovative analyses of high-dimensional neurophysiological and
  neuroimaging data.

- Contribute to experimental design and prepare manuscripts for related studies.

- Participate in intra-mural group activities, including presentation at
  lab meetings and collaboration with other lab members and clinicians.

*About you*

Essential: The successful applicant will possess the following: PhD in
mathematics, physics, bioengineering, computer sciences or related field;
demonstrated ability to implement mathematical methods in code; evidence of
strong oral and written communication skills.

Desirable: Ideally candidates may also have a published track record in
analysis of non-linear dynamical systems, particularly neural mass or neural
field models or coupled non-linear oscillators; previous experience with
GPU programming or high performance computing clusters; previous experience in
neuroscience research; or expertise in time series analysis or signal
processing.

*About the lab*

Led by Prof Michael Breakspear, the Systems Neuroscience Group (SNG) is an
independent research team within QIMR Berghofer. The SNG is a multidisciplinary
group who undertake innovative computational modelling and analysis of brain
activity in health and disease.

QIMR Berghofer is a world-leading translational medical research institute.
Based in Brisbane, Australia and working in close collaboration with
clinicians and other research institutes, QIMR Berghofer is home to more than
600 scientists, students and support staff.

*Salary*

Salary range is AUD $81,395-$84,257 per annum, plus up to 15.75% superannuation,
and attractive salary packaging. This is a full time three year appointment.

Closing date is  15 October 2017
