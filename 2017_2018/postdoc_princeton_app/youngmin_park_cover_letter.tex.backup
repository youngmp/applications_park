\opening{To Whom it may concern:}

My name is Youngmin Park. I am a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh department of mathematics, working in the areas of weakly coupled oscillators and neural field models. I expect to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in May of 2018 under the direction of my advsior Bard Ermentrout.

My work is largely in the realm of dynamical systems with a strong emphasis on neuroscience-motivated problems. To be more specific, my masters thesis is on the phase response curve of piecewise smooth oscillators, a topic which I continue to pursue today. Other recent work involves the reduction of high dimensional conductance-based or mean-field models to low dimensional scalar models.

With my application, I include a curriculum vitae (which includes a list of publications and links to source code).

Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Youngmin Park
