We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to join an NIH/NSF funded interdisciplinary project that includes Joshua Gold (University of Pennsylvania), Krešo Josić (University of Houston), and Zack Kilpatrick (University of Colorado, Boulder). Our aim is to understand how the brain accumulates evidence in dynamic environments. The project is guided by the overriding hypothesis that brain networks involved in decision-making computations incorporate learned expectations of the environment to implement adaptive decision-making. We seek a candidate who can work at the interface of experimental, computational, and theoretical neuroscience. As part of an interdisciplinary team, The candidate will develop models of neural circuits that approximate normative evidence accumulation in dynamic environments. The candidate will also help to validate these models, using behavioral data from humans and neural recordings from primates performing dynamic decision tasks.

For further information please contact Krešimir Josić (josic@math.uh.edu) or Zack Kilpatrick (zpkilpat@colorado.edu)
