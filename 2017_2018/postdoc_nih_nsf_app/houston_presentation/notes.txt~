stationary bump with eps=0

and mention centroid

translation + perturbation off bump

fix statement of problem. move or remove fredholm in this slide.

mention odd,even in H(x1,x2)

if we choose k(x) = a+bcos(x) then H(x)=sinx

only show existence of hopf (?)

and include existence of traveling wave

remove stability of 2d. but mention we have results

see ermentrout rubin jalics, smooth waves locked to moving stimulus.

slow synapses, + using techniques similar to rubin rubin ermentrout,

be careful about positive and negative with voltage models and synapses

mostly look at fixed point case.
