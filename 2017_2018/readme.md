Only postdoc applications this year.

Folders contain a text file of the advertisement. They used to contain application materials for that position, but redundant documents were moved to the parent directory.

Offers were from Brandeis, Penn (neuroscience lab), and U of Houston.

The folders postdoc_penn_audio_app/ and postdoc_nih_nsf_app/ also contain raw beamer presentation files for the on-campus interviews at Penn and Houston, respectively.

Accepted the Penn offer.
