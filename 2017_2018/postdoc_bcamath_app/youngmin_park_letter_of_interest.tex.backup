I have a strong interest in working with Dr. Rodrigues, as his research is intriguing, impactful, and relevant to my interests. I particularly enjoy the direct usage of mean field models and bifurcation analyses to describe experimental observations \cite{rodrigues2009transitions,breakspear2005unifying}. While I have experience in analyzing neural models through analytical and numerical techniques \cite{park2016weakly,park2016infinitesimal} including a mean-field cortical model first studied in \cite{pinto_ermentrout_2001_siam}, my research has not yet afforded the opportunity to use experimental data to motivate the analysis.

Other publications by Dr. Rodrigues coincide strongly with my research. In \cite{rodrigues2006genesis}, the authors discuss the transitions from oscillatory solutions to spike-wave solutions in a thalamic circuitry component of a mean-field model. Although I am unfamiliar with the biology of this particular problem, I recognize that the model reduction and piecewise linear approximation make the analysis tractable.

In \cite{rodrigues2010mappings}, the authors consider mappings from a macroscopic cortical model to microscoptic conductance-based models. I find the generality of the models considered intriguing. As mentioned in my research statement, I have some interest in this type of analysis.
