My doctoral research in dimension reduction resulted in winning the prestigious \textbf{Andrew Mellon Predoctoral Fellowship}, awarded to doctoral students of exceptional promise and ability. I was the first math-bio doctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh to receive this award. At the University of Pennsylvania, I collaborated closely with neuroscientists and published ground-breaking models to explain data produced by the world's leading auditory labs. At Brandeis, my work on molecular motors led to winning the competitive PIMS Postdoctoral Fellowship, leading to my work at the University of Manitoba. I continue independent and collaborative work while publishing in multiple fields.
