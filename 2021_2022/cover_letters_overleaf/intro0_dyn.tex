I hold a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh advised by G. Bard Ermentrout, and now hold a postdoctoral position at Brandeis University advised by Thomas G. Fai. I specialize in \textbf{deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems}, \textbf{bifurcation theory}, \textbf{perturbation methods}, and \textbf{non-local integro-differential equations}, with applications to neuroscience and cell physiology.
