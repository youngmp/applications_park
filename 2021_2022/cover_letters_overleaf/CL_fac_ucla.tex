\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,}

I am applying for the position of tenure-track assistant professor at the \School~Department of Mathematics. \input{intro0}

\input{research}

\School~features strong researchers in mathematical biology such as \textbf{Mason Porter} and \textbf{Tom Chou}. My research experience will be used to augment their work through collaborations, and I will help enhance the department's reputation through my independent research program. I use dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to solve problems of oscillator synchrony in biological neural networks, molecular transport in neurons, and network function in cortical networks (through subspace identification and machine learning).

\input{teaching}

As part of my application I include a curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement. Please request additional details as needed, and I look forward to our correspondence.

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
